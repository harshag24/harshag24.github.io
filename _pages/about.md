<!-- ![Harsh Agrawal Coding](/images/home.jpg){: .align-left width="300px"} -->
👋 Hi, I'm Harsh Agrawal, a passionate Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, specializing in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

### 🧠 My Passion for AI and Machine Learning

My journey with computers began in 8th grade when I first started coding in Java. By the time I was in 10th grade, I had earned my certification and developed a deep love for the field of computer science. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, where I immersed myself in numerous courses, ultimately choosing to specialize in Machine Learning (ML).

### 📚 Educational Endeavors

My undergraduate studies were a transformative period, during which I created a variety of projects and published multiple papers in the field of ML. My dedication and hard work were recognized through publications in esteemed IEEE conferences. As a Kaggle Notebooks Expert, I have also enjoyed mentoring others, sharing my knowledge and helping to guide their journeys in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Now, as I near the completion of my Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University, my focus remains steadfast: to leverage AI and ML to drive positive change and solve real-world problems. Relevant courses I've taken include Programming Design Paradigm, DBMS, Algorithms, Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Professional Experience

Currently, I am working as a Data Science Co-op at Amazon Robotics, where I have applied my skills to develop complex data solutions and custom algorithms, significantly improving operational efficiencies. I designed a comprehensive downtime monitoring system for robotic arms using AWS Lambda and Athena, which successfully mapped 60% of occurrences. I also developed a system to classify and categorize support tickets, reducing backlog through custom clustering algorithms.

Previously, I interned at Pheme Software Pvt. Ltd as a Python Developer, where I contributed to the development of an AI-based online examination system that reduced cheating incidents by 20% and increased user engagement by 40%.

### 🌟 Project Highlights
  - Developed a framework using CNNs to classify EEG patterns indicative of harmful brain activity, achieving 81.92% accuracy with EfficientNetB2.
  - Created an on-device Disaster Scene Parsing and Detection system, awarded 3rd prize at the 2nd Khoury Annual Project Pitch-A-thon.
  - Implemented a Personalized GIF-based Reply Recommendation System, increasing prediction accuracy by 45% using the Large Language Model – Llama.
  - Proposed a "One-vs-All" methodology for classifying cassava leaf diseases, achieving 85.64% accuracy and published the research on IEEE Xplore.
  - Developed a heart failure prediction model using machine learning with an exploratory data analysis approach, achieving significant recognition in the 2021 International Conference on Intelligent Technologies.
  - Designed a pneumonia detection system using image processing and deep learning techniques, showcased at the 2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Systems.

### 🚀 Future Aspirations

As I approach graduation in August, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. My goal is to continue developing practical AI solutions that make a positive impact on the world.

### 📚 Sharing and Learning

I believe in the power of community and knowledge sharing. As a proud Kaggle Notebooks Expert, I enjoy mentoring others and contributing to the field of AI through collaborative learning and innovation.

### 🌌 Personal Interests

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am fascinated by the mysteries of space and love to unwind with music and gaming.
