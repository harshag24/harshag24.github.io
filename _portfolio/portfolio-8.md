### Introduction
JavaOS is a project designed to simulate the functionalities of a real-world operating system. The project aims to provide a user-friendly environment where users can perform basic OS operations such as file management, text editing, and running terminal commands.

### Materials and Methods

- **Languages and Technologies Used**: The project is entirely implemented in Java. The development environment includes standard Java libraries and tools.

- **Features**:
  - **Login System**: Users can log in using a predefined username and password.
  - **Desktop Environment**: Provides a graphical user interface with icons and shortcuts.
  - **File Navigation**: Users can explore directories and open folders within the simulated OS.
  - **Notepad**: A simple text editor for creating and editing text files.
  - **Terminal**: A command-line interface where users can run commands such as `ipconfig`.
  - **Web Browser**: Opens Microsoft Edge with Google as the default homepage.

### Implementation Details
To run the project, execute `FirstPage.java` and log in with the username "harsh" and password "password". The desktop environment will load, providing access to various functionalities like file navigation, notepad, terminal, and a web browser.

### Results and Discussion
JavaOS successfully simulates the basic operations of an operating system, providing a useful tool for understanding OS concepts and developing Java programming skills. The project demonstrates effective use of Java for GUI development and system simulation.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Tools**: Java Development Kit (JDK), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

### Conclusion
JavaOS is a comprehensive project that simulates the essential functions of an operating system. It serves as an educational tool for learning about OS concepts and Java programming. By providing a graphical user interface and terminal access, it offers a hands-on experience with system-level operations.
